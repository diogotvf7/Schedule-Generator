# Schedule-Generator
Schedule Generator for college classes

This program is used to generate all possible schedules (without overlapping classes)
considering the input classes placed in "files/Classes". After that you just have to update
the new path in the "main.cpp" file, and you're ready to go. The schedules will be generated to
"files/Generated" and can be organized by rating (uncomment line 81 of schedules_list.cpp and introduce
each lecturers' grade from 0 to 10 - the schedule grade is based on the average of the grades introduced
so obviously the more grades you input the more accurate the output grades will be).
Have fun!
